Process :
- any program running on your computer
- it is called a Task
- multiprocessor > run multiple processes at the same time(parallel)
- processes run in separate memory

Threads
- anything execution within a process
- the unit of execution within a process
- each process has at least one thread
- threads share the same memory space within a process
- a process is basically a main thread

Single Thread
- so far all the programs we have written are all single threaded

Python Thread
1. using the function
    1) define a function
    2) create instance of built in Thread class 't=Thread(target=functionName,args)'
    3) start the thread 't.start()'
2. Extending the thread class
    1) extend the built in class Thread
        class firstThread(Thread)
    2) override the run method
    3) make the instance of the class
3. without extending the thread class
    1) hybrid approach of creating thread
        class firstThread:
    2) make the instance
        obj = firstThread()
        t = Thread(target=obj.functionName, args)

A process is called a main thread
A thread is a portion of code

Thread Communication
- the threads needs to communicate with each other to share some kind of information
- solve
    1) using the Boolean Flag
    2) Using wait and notify
